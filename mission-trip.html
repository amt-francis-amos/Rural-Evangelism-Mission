            <h1>Plan A Mission Trip</h1>
            <p>As a Missionary I strongly believe in the Great Commission as authorized by Jesus Christ in Matthew 28:18-20. Therefore I’ve spent more than half of my life traveling to towns and hinterlands to preach. We are mandated to ‘’go’’ to all Nations to make disciples and baptize those who will hearken to the voice of the Lord and the gospel.
                Church of Christ was established in 1960’s in Ghana by some American Missionaries and passed on to some few faithful men and to others etc, and now we have several congregations in several places in the country. However, there are 1000’s of villages that have not witnessed or heard about the gospel. I have very limited resources to reach everywhere hence my invitation to You to consider leaving your ‘comfort zone’ and come to Central Region of Ghana to preach the gospel.
                Ghana is one of the most peaceful countries in Africa and therefore I am allaying your fears of being kidnapped or have an encounter with guns or being maimed. I would spent my entire time with You on each schedule and make sure that every individual, missionaries, deacons and Ministers. I would make sure that every Missionary returns home safely.
                In case you have an inquiries and questions, kindly contact my American Team and they will tell you more. I look forward to working with You all.
                Because of Calvary.
